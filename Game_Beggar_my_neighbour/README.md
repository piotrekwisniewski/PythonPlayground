# Beggar My Neighbour
=====================

## Overview
-----------

This script simulates the card game "Beggar My Neighbour" between two players. Each player is initially dealt half of a reduced deck of cards (Ace to 9). The game continues until one player wins all the cards or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Features
------------

- **Card Deck**: A simplified deck with Ace to 9 for each suit.
- **Gameplay**: Players draw cards in turns. The player with the higher card wins both cards. If cards have the same power, a "battle" ensues where each player lays down additional cards until one wins.
- **Stopping Condition**: The game ends after a maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops.

## Usage
-----

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script.
2. **Gameplay**: The script will simulate the game, displaying each round's results.
3. **Outcome**: The game ends when one player wins all cards or reaches the maximum number of iterations.

- `random` module (part of the Python Standard Library)

## Example Output
