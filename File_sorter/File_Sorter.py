# WELCOME TO File_Sorter!
# This script will sort all the files in the catalogue you choose into several categories.

"""
Below, in the dictionary named `fileTypesDict`, you can check what categories are predefined and what file extensions
are assigned to each category. Feel free to add your own categories or file extensions or move file extensions to other categories.
`fileTypesDict.keys()` are for the category names, and `fileTypesDict.values()` are for file extensions assigned to this category.
"""

# !!!ATTENTION!!!
# If there is a directory named by the category (e.g., if you used this script before) and there is a file with the same name
# in the category (destination) directory, it will be overwritten!!!

# This will be upgraded in the future to choose what to do in such conflicts, but for now, this script is just for training.
# It will also be upgraded with a log file containing data and history of usage.
# ... someday :)
